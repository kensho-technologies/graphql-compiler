    """Return a tuple of ASTs with the three parts of a macro edge given the directive mapping.

    Args:
        schema: GraphQL schema object, created using the GraphQL library
        ast: GraphQL library AST OperationDefinition object, describing the GraphQL that is defining
             the macro edge.
        macro_directives: Dict[str, List[Tuple[AST object, Directive]]], mapping the name of an
                          encountered directive to a list of its appearances, each described by
                          a tuple containing the AST with that directive and the directive object
                          itself.
        macro_edge_args: dict mapping strings to any type, containing any arguments the macro edge
                         requires in order to function.
        type_equivalence_hints: optional dict of GraphQL interface or type -> GraphQL union.
                                Used as a workaround for GraphQL's lack of support for
                                inheritance across "types" (i.e. non-interfaces), as well as a
                                workaround for Gremlin's total lack of inheritance-awareness.
                                The key-value pairs in the dict specify that the "key" type
                                is equivalent to the "value" type, i.e. that the GraphQL type or
                                interface in the key is the most-derived common supertype
                                of every GraphQL type in the "value" GraphQL union.
                                Recursive expansion of type equivalence hints is not performed,
                                and only type-level correctness of this argument is enforced.
                                See README.md for more details on everything this parameter does.
                                *****
                                Be very careful with this option, as bad input here will
                                lead to incorrect output queries being generated.
