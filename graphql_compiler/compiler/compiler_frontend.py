"""Front-end for GraphQL to database queries compiler.

High-level overview of the GraphQL ingestion process that outputs the compiler's
internal representation (IR) via the graphql_to_ir() function:
    - The function receives a GraphQL string and a GraphQL schema.
      How the schema is constructed is beyond the scope of this package.
    - It uses the graphql library to parse the GraphQL string into
      an abstract syntax tree representation (AST).
    - It validates the GraphQL string using the schema.
    - Finally, it converts the validated GraphQL string into an internal representation (IR):
      a list of BasicBlock (blocks.py) objects, which may further contain
      Expression (expressions.py) objects.

To get from GraphQL AST to IR, we follow the following pattern:
    step 0. preprocessing:  (see _compile_ast_node_to_ir())
        - read any directives at the current AST node;
        - read the inline fragment at the current AST node, if one exists;
        - read any child fields of the current AST node, splitting them into two groups:
          property fields and vertex fields; all property fields must precede the vertex fields
          for the AST to be valid;

    step 1. apply all @filter directives that apply to the current field
            (see _compile_ast_node_to_ir() and directive_helpers.get_local_filter_directives())

    We now proceed with one of three cases (P, V and F), depending on whether
    the current AST node is a property AST node, vertex AST node, or inline fragment, respectively.
    The root AST node is always a vertex AST node.

    *** P-steps ***
    step P-2. Process @output directives.
    ***************

    *** V-steps ***
    step V-2. Process @tag directives at all property field children of the current AST node.

    step V-3. Recurse into any property field children of the current AST node
              (property fields cannot have property fields of their own, see _compile_vertex_ast()).

    step V-4. Property field processing complete:  (see _compile_vertex_ast())
        - mark the current location in the query, since all @filter directives that apply to the
          current field have already been processed;
        - process the output_source directive, if it exists

    step V-5. Recurse into any vertex field children of the current AST node:
              (see _compile_vertex_ast())
        - before recursing into each vertex:
          - process any @optional and @fold directives present on the child AST node;
          - process any @output within a @fold context,
            and prevent further traversal if one is present;
        - after returning from each vertex:
          - return to the marked query location using the appropriate manner,
            depending on whether @optional was present on the child or not;
          - if the visited vertex had a @fold or @optional directive,
            undo the processing performed at previous steps;
    ***************

    *** F-steps ***
    step F-2. Emit a type coercion block if appropriate, then recurse into the fragment's selection.
