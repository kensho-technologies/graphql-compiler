###
# A MatchQuery is a representation of the entire MATCH query formed by all IR blocks in a given
# compilation unit. It consists of two parts:
#   - match_traversals: a list of lists of MatchStep objects, where each list of MatchStep objects
#                       defines a single traversal chain in the MATCH query.
#   - folds: a dict of FoldScopeLocation -> list of IR blocks defining that @fold scope,
#            not including the Fold and Unfold blocks that signal the start and end of the @fold.
#   - output_block: a ConstructResult IR block, which defines how the query's results are returned.
#   - where_block: an optional Filter block, which determines the WHERE statement for the query.
MatchQuery = namedtuple('MatchQuery', ('match_traversals', 'folds', 'output_block', 'where_block'))


###
# A MatchStep contains all basic blocks that correspond to a given location in the query.
# MatchStep boundaries occur when traversing edges, and when constructing the final output
# of the query. Its fields can hold the following types of basic blocks:
#   - root_block: QueryRoot, Traverse, Recurse or Backtrack block, which forms the root of the step
#   - coerce_type_block: a CoerceType block, which acts as a "where_block" on the type of the step
#   - where_block: an optional Filter block that corresponds to the 'where' clause in the MATCH step
#   - as_block: an optional MarkLocation block that corresponds to the 'as' clause in the MATCH step
