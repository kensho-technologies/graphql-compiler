"""Workarounds for OrientDB scheduler issue that causes poor query planning for certain queries.

For purposes of query planning, the OrientDB query planner ignores "where:" clauses
that hit indexes but do not use the "=" operator. For example, "CONTAINS" can be used to check
that a field covered by an index is in a specified list of values, and can therefore be covered
by an index, but OrientDB will ignore this. When no equality ("=") checks on indexed columns
are present, OrientDB will generate a query plan that starts execution at the class with
lowest cardinality, which can lead to excessive numbers of scanned and discarded records.

Assuming the query planner creates a query plan where a location with CONTAINS is
the first in the execution order, the execution system will apply indexes
to speed up this operation. Therefore, it's sufficient to trick the query planner into
always creating such a query plan, even though it thinks indexes cannot be used in the query.

Valid query execution start points for the OrientDB query planner must satisfy the following:
    - Must not be "optional: true".
    - Must not have a "while:" clause nor follow a location that has one.
    - Must have a "class:" defined. This class is used for cardinality estimation, and to
      look for available indexes that may cover any "where:" clause that may be present.

The optimizations in this file improve performance by enabling execution start points according
to the following assumptions:
    1. Start points with "where:" clauses that reference only local fields (i.e. not tagged values
       from other query locations) are always better than start points without a "where:".
       This is because the filter will have to be applied one way or the other, so we might as well
       apply it early.
    2. If no such start points are available, we'd like to make available as many start points
       as possible, since we'd like OrientDB to start at the start point whose class has
       the lowest possible cardinality.

The process of applying the optimizations is as follows:
    - Exclude and ignore all query steps that are inside a fold, optional, or recursion scope,
      or have a "where:" clause that references a non-local (i.e. tagged) field.
    - Find all remaining query steps with "where:" clauses that reference only local fields.
    - If any are found, we guide our actions from assumption 1 above:
        - Ensure they have a defined "class:" -- i.e. the OrientDB scheduler will consider them
          valid start points.
        - Then, prune all other query steps (ones without such "where:" clauses) by removing their
          "class:" clause, making them invalid as query start points for OrientDB's scheduler.
    - If none are found, we guide our actions from assumption 2 above:
        - Ensure that all query points not inside fold, optional, or recursion scope contain
          a "class:" clause. That increases the number of available query start points,
          so OrientDB can choose the start point of lowest cardinality.
