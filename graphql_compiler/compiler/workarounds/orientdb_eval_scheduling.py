"""Workaround for OrientDB query scheduling issue with eval() statements.

OrientDB <2.2.17 (and perhaps future versions as well) fail to pick up $matched
query dependencies if those dependencies are only used within an eval() statement.
The workaround pulls out all such dependencies out of the eval() statement in a way
that doesn't introduce incorrect output, but ensures correct scheduling of the query.
More details: https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/issues/7160

This workaround doesn't work in OrientDB <2.2.17 due to another bug.
The workaround should fix the problem starting with OrientDB 2.2.18.
