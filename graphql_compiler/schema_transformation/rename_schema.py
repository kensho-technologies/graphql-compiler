"""Implement renaming and suppressing parts of a GraphQL schema.

There are two ways to rename a part of a schema: 1-1 renaming and 1-many renaming.

1-1 renaming replaces the name of a type, field, or enum value in the schema. For instance, given
the following part of a schema:
    type Dog {
        name: String
    }
    type Human {
        pet: Dog
    }
1-1 renaming "Dog" to "NewDog" on a schema containing this object type (but not containing a
type named "NewDog") would produce a schema almost identical to the original schema except
with the NewDog object type replacing Dog everywhere it appears.
    type NewDog {
        name: String
    }
    type Human {
        pet: NewDog
    }
If "Dog" also appeared as a field in the schema's root type, it would be renamed to "NewDog" there
as well.

1-many renaming is an operation intended specifically for any of the following:
- fields in object types
- fields in interface types
- enum values
In 1-many renaming, the same field or enum value is mapped to multiple names. For instance, given
the following type in a schema:
    type Dog {
        name: String
    }
1-many renaming the "Dog" type's "name" field to "name" and "secondname" would produce a schema
almost identical to the original schema except with both fields representing the same underlying
data.
    type Dog {
        name: String
        secondname: String
    }

Suppressing part of the schema removes it altogether. For instance, given the following part of a
schema:
    type Dog {
        name: String
    }
suppressing "Dog" would produce an otherwise-identical schema but with that type (and therefore all
its fields) removed. If "Dog" also appeared as a field in the schema's root type, it would be
removed there as well.

Operations that are already supported:
- 1-1 renaming of object types, unions, enums, and interfaces.
- Suppressing types that don't implement an interface.
- Suppressing unions.

Operations that are not yet supported but will be implemented:
- Suppressions for fields, enums, enum values, interfaces, and types that implement interfaces.
- Renamings and suppressions for scalar types
- 1-1 and 1-many renamings for fields and enum values.

Renaming constraints:
- If you suppress all member types in a union, you must also suppress the union.
- If you suppress a type X, no other type Y may keep fields of type X (those fields must be
  suppressed, which requires field suppression which hasn't been implemented yet). However, if type
  X has a field of that type X, it is legal to suppress type X without explicitly suppressing that
  particular field.
- You may not suppress all types in the schema's root type.
- All names must be valid GraphQL names.
- Names may not conflict with each other. For instance, you may not rename both "Foo" and "Bar" to
  "Baz". You also may not rename anything to "Baz" if a type "Baz" already exists and is not also
  being renamed or suppressed.

    """Create a RenamedSchemaDescriptor; rename/suppress types and root type fields using renamings.

    Any type, interface, enum, or fields of the root type/query type whose name
    appears in renamings will be renamed to the corresponding value if the value is not None. If the
    value is None, it will be suppressed in the renamed schema and queries will not be able to
    access it.

    Any such names that do not appear in renamings will be unchanged. Directives will never be
    renamed.

    In addition, some operations have not been implemented yet (see module-level docstring for more

    Returns:

    Raises:
        - CascadingSuppressionError if a type suppression would require further suppressions

          CascadingSuppressionError, InvalidTypeNameError, SchemaStructureError, and
          SchemaNameConflictError, so handling exceptions of type SchemaTransformError will also
          catch all of its subclasses. This will change after the error classes are modified so that
          errors can be fixed programmatically, at which point it will make sense for the user to

          of alphanumeric characters and underscores, if it starts with a numeric character, or
          if it starts with double underscores
        - SchemaStructureError if the schema does not have the expected form; in particular, if
          the AST does not represent a valid schema, if any query type field does not have the
          same name as the type that it queries, if the schema contains type extensions or
          input object definitions, or if the schema contains mutations or subscriptions
