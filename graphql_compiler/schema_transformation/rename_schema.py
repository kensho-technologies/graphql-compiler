"""Implement renaming and suppressing parts of a GraphQL schema.

There are two ways to rename a part of a schema: 1-1 renaming and 1-many renaming.

1-1 renaming replaces the name of a type, field, or enum value in the schema. For instance, given
the following part of a schema:
    type Dog {
        name: String
    }
    type Human {
        pet: Dog
    }
1-1 renaming "Dog" to "NewDog" on a schema containing this object type (but not containing a
type named "NewDog") would produce a schema almost identical to the original schema except
with the NewDog object type replacing Dog everywhere it appears.
    type NewDog {
        name: String
    }
    type Human {
        pet: NewDog
    }
If "Dog" also appeared as a field in the schema's root type, it would be renamed to "NewDog" there
as well.

1-many renaming is an operation intended specifically for any of the following:
- fields in object types
- fields in interface types
- enum values
In 1-many renaming, the same field or enum value is mapped to multiple names. For instance, given
the following type in a schema:
    type Dog {
        name: String
    }
1-many renaming the "Dog" type's "name" field to "name" and "secondname" would produce a schema
almost identical to the original schema except with both fields representing the same underlying
data.
    type Dog {
        name: String
        secondname: String
    }

Suppressing part of the schema removes it altogether. For instance, given the following part of a
schema:
    type Dog {
        name: String
    }
suppressing "Dog" would produce an otherwise-identical schema but with that type (and therefore all
its fields) removed. If "Dog" also appeared as a field in the schema's root type, it would be
removed there as well.

For both 1-1 or 1-many renaming, renamings only apply to types, fields, and enum values that exist
in the original schema. For example, if a schema contains a type named "Foo" and a type named "Bar"
but not a type named "Baz" and type_renamings maps "Foo" to "Bar" and "Bar" to "Baz", then the
renamed schema will contain a type named "Bar" (corresponding to the original schema's type "Foo")
and a type named "Baz" (corresponding to the original schema's type "Bar"), instead of containing
two types both named "Baz".

Operations that are already supported:
- 1-1 renaming of object types, unions, enums, and interfaces.
- Suppressing types that don't implement an interface.
- Suppressing unions.

Operations that are not yet supported but will be implemented:
- Suppressions for fields, enums, enum values, interfaces, and types that implement interfaces.
- Renamings and suppressions for scalar types
- 1-1 and 1-many renamings for fields and enum values.

Renaming constraints:
- If you suppress all member types in a union, you must also suppress the union.
- If you suppress a type X, no other type Y may keep fields of type X (those fields must be
  suppressed, which requires field suppression which hasn't been implemented yet). However, if type
  X has a field of that type X, it is legal to suppress type X without explicitly suppressing that
  particular field.
- You may not suppress all types in the schema's root type.
- All names must be valid GraphQL names.
- Names may not conflict with each other. For instance, you may not rename both "Foo" and "Bar" to
  "Baz". You also may not rename anything to "Baz" if a type "Baz" already exists and is not also
  being renamed or suppressed. The same rules apply for fields that belong to the same type, since
  they share a namespace as well.
- There exist special rules for iterable renamings (e.g. if renamings are represented as a
  dictionary)-- specifically, no-op renamings are not allowed.
  - If type_renamings argument is iterable:
    - A string type_name may be in type_renamings only if there exists a type in the original schema
      named type_name (since otherwise that entry would not affect any type in the schema).
    - If string type_name is in type_renamings, then type_renamings[type_name] != type_name (since
      if they were the same, then applying the renaming would not change the type named type_name).
