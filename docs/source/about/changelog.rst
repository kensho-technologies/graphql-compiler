Changelog
=========

Current development version
---------------------------

v2.0.0 (upcoming release)
-------------------------

- **BREAKING** Change the :code:`GraphQLDateTime` scalar type from being timezone-aware to
  being timezone-naive to follow the usual database convention of naming the timezone-naive
  type "datetime" and avoid confusion after we've added both timezone-aware and timezone-naive
  types.

------

   union type.
   `#131 <https://github.com/kensho-technologies/graphql-compiler/pull/131>`__

Thanks to :code:`cw6515` for the fix!

v1.8.1
------

-  Fix a bug that arose when using certain type coercions that the
   compiler optimizes away to a no-op.
   `#127 <https://github.com/kensho-technologies/graphql-compiler/pull/127>`__

Thanks to :code:`bojanserafimov` for the fix!

v1.8.0
------

-  Allow :code:`@optional` vertex fields nested inside other :code:`@optional`
   vertex fields.
   `#120 <https://github.com/kensho-technologies/graphql-compiler/pull/120>`__
-  Fix a bug that accidentally disallowed having two :code:`@recurse`
   directives within the same vertex field.
   `#115 <https://github.com/kensho-technologies/graphql-compiler/pull/115>`__
-  Enforce that all required directives are present in the schema.
   `#114 <https://github.com/kensho-technologies/graphql-compiler/pull/114>`__

   tracked and processed.

Thanks to :code:`amartyashankha`, :code:`cw6515`, and :code:`yangsong97` for their
contributions!

v1.7.2
------

-  Fix possible incorrect query execution due to dropped type coercions.
   `#110 <https://github.com/kensho-technologies/graphql-compiler/pull/110>`__
   `#113 <https://github.com/kensho-technologies/graphql-compiler/pull/113>`__

v1.7.0
------

-  Add a new :code:`@filter` operator: :code:`intersects`.
   `#100 <https://github.com/kensho-technologies/graphql-compiler/pull/100>`__
-  Add an optimization that helps OrientDB choose a good starting point
   for query evaluation.
   `#102 <https://github.com/kensho-technologies/graphql-compiler/pull/102>`__

The new optimization pass manages what type information is visible at
different points in the generated query. By exposing additional type
information, or hiding existing type information, the compiler maximizes
the likelihood that OrientDB will start evaluating the query at the
location of lowest cardinality. This produces a massive performance
benefit -- up to 1000x on some queries!

Thanks to :code:`yangsong97` for making his first contribution with the
:code:`intersects` operator!

v1.6.2
------

-  Fix incorrect filtering in :code:`@optional` locations.
   `#95 <https://github.com/kensho-technologies/graphql-compiler/pull/95>`__

Thanks to :code:`amartyashankha` for the fix!

v1.6.1
------

-  Fix a bad compilation bug on :code:`@fold` and :code:`@optional` in the same
   scope.
   `#86 <https://github.com/kensho-technologies/graphql-compiler/pull/86>`__

Thanks to :code:`amartyashankha` for the fix!

v1.6.0
------

-  Add full support for :code:`Decimal` data, including both filtering and
   output.
   `#91 <https://github.com/kensho-technologies/graphql-compiler/pull/91>`__

v1.5.0
------

-  Allow expanding vertex fields within :code:`@optional` scopes.
   `#83 <https://github.com/kensho-technologies/graphql-compiler/pull/83>`__

This is a massive feature, totaling over 4000 lines of changes and
hundreds of hours of many engineers' time. Special thanks to
:code:`amartyashankha` for taking point on the implementation!

This feature implements a workaround for a limitation of OrientDB, where
:code:`MATCH` treats optional vertices as terminal and does not allow
subsequent traversals from them. To work around this issue, the compiler
rewrites the query into several disjoint queries whose union produces
the exact same results as a single query that allows optional
traversals. See this :ref:`link <compound_optional_performance_penalty>` for more details.

v1.4.1
------

-  Make MATCH use the :code:`BETWEEN` operator when possible, to avoid `an
   OrientDB performance
   issue <https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/issues/8230>`__
   `#70 <https://github.com/kensho-technologies/graphql-compiler/pull/70>`__

Thanks to :code:`amartyashankha` for this contribution!

------

-  Enable expanding vertex fields inside :code:`@fold`
   `#64 <https://github.com/kensho-technologies/graphql-compiler/pull/64>`__

v1.2.1
------

   lists <https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/issues/7811>`__
   `#42 <https://github.com/kensho-technologies/graphql-compiler/pull/42>`__

v1.2.0

   `#31 <https://github.com/kensho-technologies/graphql-compiler/pull/31>`__
-  Make it possible to use :code:`@fold` together with union-typed vertex
   fields
   `#32 <https://github.com/kensho-technologies/graphql-compiler/pull/32>`__

Thanks to :code:`ColCarroll` for making the compiler support Python 3!
