# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project!

To get started, make sure that you have `pipenv`, `docker` and `docker-compose` installed
on your computer.

Integration tests are run against multiple SQL databases, some of which require dialect specific
installations to be available in the development environment.
Currently this affects MySQL. A compatible driver can be installed on OSX with:
```bash
brew install mysql
```
or on Ubuntu with:
```bash
apt-get install python-mysqldb
```

For more details on other systems please refer to
[MySQL dialect information](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/dialects/mysql.html).

Once the dev environment is prepared, from the root of the repository, run:
```
docker-compose up -d
pipenv sync --dev
pipenv shell

py.test graphql_compiler/tests
```

If you have any trouble starting the mysql database, make sure mysql service is not already 
running outside of docker. You can stop mysql service in OSX with:
```bash 
brew services stop mysql
```
or on Ubuntu with 
```bash
service mysql stop
```

Some snapshot and integration tests take longer to setup, run, and teardown. These can be optionally
skipped during development by running the tests with the `--skip-slow` flag:
```bash
py.test graphql_compiler/tests --skip-slow
```

A test method or class can be marked as slow to be skipped in this fashion by decorating with the
`@pytest.mark.slow` flag.
